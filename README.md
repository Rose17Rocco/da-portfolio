# da-portfolio
My debut into the field of data anlytics along with a short biography, my professional resume and a collection of data analytics projects demonstrating Excel, SQL, Python and R analytics workflows. 

# Welcome!
This repository showcases a collection of my data analytics projects using **EXcel**, **SQL**. and **Python**. Each project demonstrates a key part of my analytics process - from cleaning and transforming data to drawing insights from real-world datasets.

##Projects Overview
|Project|Tools|Description|
|----------|---------|------------|
|[Client Data Cleaning & Enrichment](./01_client_data_cleaning_excel)|Excel|Cleaned and enriched a B2B client list to standardize company names, addresses, and contact info, improving accuracy and consistency for sales analysis.|
|[Titanic Survival Analysis]|(./02_titanic_survival_analysis)|Python(Pandas, Matplotlib)|Analyzed Titanic passenger data to determine whether ticket class influenced survival rates. Included visualiztions and hypothesis testing.|
|[US Homelessness SQL Analysis](./03_homelessness_sql_project)|BigQuery /SQL |Explored homelessness data to identify states where unsheltered homelessness rates are below thresholds or vary by population segment.|

## Tools and Skills Demonstrated
**Excel**Data Cleaning, lookup functions, enrichment, conditional logic
**Python**Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
**SQL/BigQuery**Filtering, joins, aggregations, and percentage-based logic. 
**Data Documentation**Readable analysis summaries and data dictionaries.

## Next Steps
I'm currently exploring:
-Building a small **SQLite or PostgreSQL database** from the cleaned client data. 
- Creating a **dashboard** (Power BI or Looker Studio) for visual analytics.
